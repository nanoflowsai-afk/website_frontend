1️⃣ Overview of the FinTech Sub-Industry
FinTech startups are companies that use technology to deliver financial services such as payments, lending, banking, insurance, investments, and expense management. These businesses rely heavily on software platforms, APIs, data, and automation to operate efficiently.
As FinTech companies grow, they face challenges like high user volume, compliance requirements, security risks, and operational complexity. To scale safely and profitably, FinTech startups need AI-powered systems, automation, and secure software architecture from the beginning.
